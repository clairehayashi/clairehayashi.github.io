## Project Overview

This interactive art installation combines digital animation with physical interaction to create an immersive experience for gallery visitors. Using motion sensors and projection mapping, the installation responds to the movements of spectators with dynamic light patterns and synchronized sound.

## The Challenge

The gallery wanted to create an engaging experience that would appeal to visitors of all ages while showcasing the intersection of art and technology. The installation needed to be intuitive enough for anyone to interact with, yet complex enough to create a memorable experience.

## My Approach

I began by sketching various interaction concepts in Procreate, focusing on how movement could translate to visual feedback. After several iterations, I developed a system where different types of movement would trigger unique visual and audio responses.

The technical implementation involved:

- Designing animations and visual effects in Procreate
- Programming the interaction using Processing
- Setting up Arduino microcontrollers to capture motion data
- Calibrating projectors for optimal visual display

## The Result

The installation has become one of the gallery's most popular exhibits, with visitors spending an average of 15 minutes engaging with the work. The project has been featured in several art and technology publications and has led to commissions for similar installations at other venues.
